# Unexpected Behavior with Implicit Conversion Operators and Operator Overloading in C#

This code demonstrates a potential pitfall when using implicit conversion operators in C#. While implicit conversions are often convenient, they can lead to unexpected behavior if you don't define appropriate overloaded operators for all combinations of types.

The `MyClass` class defines implicit conversion operators to and from `int`.  The main function shows that the implicit conversions work as expected in some cases, but the addition of an integer to a `MyClass` object fails because the necessary operator overload is missing. 

The solution addresses this by adding an overloaded `+` operator to handle the addition of an integer to a `MyClass` object.
